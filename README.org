* Introduction

This package provides a set of commands to control frame position and size. The font size in buffers will be changed with synchronization of the updated frame geometry so that the frame width could be maintained at 80 as default.

Install:
 - Get ~moom.el~ and ~moom-font.el~ from MELPA or Github.

Setup:
 - After installing, activate Moom by =(moom-mode 1)= in your ~init.el~.

* Acknowledgment

This package is highly inspired from [[https://manytricks.com/moom/]["Moom"]] released by [[https://manytricks.com/][Many Tricks]]. Moom stands for "Mo"ve and zo"om". Cool!
